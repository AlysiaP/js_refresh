// forumla to determine how much water you should intake a day:

// weight in pounds / 2.2 = X

// X * age dependent
//     If you're younger than 30, multiply by 40
//     if you're between 30-55, multiply by 35
//     if you're older than 55, multiply by 30

// divide that sum by 28.3

// your total is how many ounces of water you should drink each day. divide that number by 8 to see your result in cups
